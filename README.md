# Rappelz Belt Builder

This is a simple tool to test different belt setups in the game [Rappelz](http://en.rappelz.webzen.com).

## Overview

During Rappelz's history it has changed how belts work (without much documnentation) and this has caused confusion. I made an old version of a belt builder, but I didn't know about version control and the source has gone missing, so I decided to make this new belt builder with the new belt mechanic with source available for updates.
